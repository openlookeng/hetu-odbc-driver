## Configuring the Data Source

Before an application uses the openLooKeng ODBC driver, the data source DSN must be configured in the ODBC data source manager of the system.

### Opening the ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)

1. Click **Start**, and choose **Control Panel**.

2. In **Control Panel**, click **System and Security**, and then click **Administrative Tools**.

3. In **Administrative Tools**, click **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)**.

   > Note: You can also type **ODBC** in the search box of the Windows 10 **Start** menu and click **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)** to open it.

### Adding the User DSN

1. In the ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit), click the **User DSN** tab and click **Add**.

2. In the displayed **Create New Data Source** dialog box, click **openLooKeng  ODBC Driver** and click **Finish**.

3. The openLooKeng  ODBC Driver configuration page is displayed. On the welcome page, enter the name of the DSN to be created in the **Name** text box, enter the additional description of the DSN in the **Description** text box, and click **Next**.

4. The second page contains the following six text boxes. The functions and usage are as follows:

   | Text Box| Description|
   |----------|----------|
   | Connect URL| IP address and port number of the openLooKeng server to be connected.|
   | Connect Config| Path of the configuration file when setting connection parameters through the connection configuration file. You can click **Browse** to select a path.|
   | User Name| User name for connecting to the openLooKeng. The default value is **root**.|
   | Password| User password, which can be left empty.|
   | Catalog| Catalog to be used by the DSN, which can be left empty. You are advised to click **Test DSN** in the upper text box and select a value from the drop-down list box.|
   | Schema| Schema to be used by the DSN, which can be left empty. You are advised to click **Test DSN** in the upper text box and select a value from the drop-down list box.|

   Set the parameters on the second page, and then click **Test DSN**. After the system displays a message indicating that the operation is successful, click **Next**.

5. In the **Statement(s)** text box on page 3, enter the initial statement sent after the connection to the openLooKeng server is established. After **Debug** is selected, the driver creates a debugging log file named **MAODBC.LOG** in **%TMP%** to record openLooKeng ODBC driver debugging information. After you click **Test DSN** on page 2, user can configure the connection character set from the **Character Set** drop-down box. Select **Enable automatic reconnect**, when the system is sending messages, it automatically reconnects with the server upon a connection failure. (The automatic reconnection function does not ensure transaction consistency. Exercise caution when enabling this function). Click **Finish**.

### Configuring the ODBC Connection for the DSN

When configuring DSN, you can set up a basic ODBC connection by providing the correct **Connect URL**, **User Name**, and **Password**. For users with advanced requirements such as SSL and Kerberos, you need to transfer the corresponding connection parameters to the driver by importing the connection configuration file.

### Connection Configuration File

When connection parameters are transferred through the connection configuration file, all connection parameters defined by openLooKeng JDBC can be configured. For details, see [Parameter Reference#](https://openLooKeng.io/docs/docs/installation/jdbc.html#parameter-reference) of openLooKeng JDBC Driver.

The connection configuration file must provide a group of parameter key-value pairs separated by lines, such as **user=root** or **SSL=true**. The driver automatically parses the parameter key values and configures the connection. The following is an example:

```
#Use "\\" or "/" to separate file paths
user=root

#password=123456

# Whether to use HTTPS connection, the default value is "false"
SSL=true

# Java Keystore file path
#SSLKeyStorePath

# Java KeyStore password
#SSLKeyStorePassword

# Java TrustStore file path
SSLTrustStorePath=F:/openLooKeng/hetuserver.jks

# Java TrustStore password
#SSLTrustStorePassword

# Kerberos service name, fixed at "HTTP"
KerberosRemoteServiceName=HTTP

# Kerberos principal
KerberosPrincipal=test

# krb5 configuration file of the user accessing to the data source
KerberosConfigPath=F:/openLooKeng/krb5.conf

# keytab configuration file of the user accessing to the data source
KerberosKeytabPath=F:/openLooKeng/user.keytab
```

After the preceding configuration is complete, click **Test DSN**. If the configuration is correct, a dialog box is displayed, indicating that the connection is successfully established. You are advised to check whether the corresponding catalog and schema are correctly displayed in the **Catalog** and **Schema** drop-down list boxes. After the data source DSN is configured, the ODBC application can be connected to the openLooKeng through the configured DSN.

## CharacterSet

The openLooKeng ODBC driver supports **both ANSI and Unicode** applications. The default connection character set is the system default character set for ANSI applications and utf8 for Unicode applications. If the character set used by the application is different from the above-mentioned character set,  it may cause garbled characters. For this, the user should specify the connection character set to adapt to the character set required by the application. The corresponding configuration of the connection character set is described as follows.

When calling the ODBC API to retrieve data, if bound to the SQL_C_WCHAR C data type buffer, the driver will return the Unicode encoded result for both ANSI and Unicode applications. When bound to the SQL_C_CHAR C data type buffer, by deafult, the driver will return to the ANSI application the result  encoded in system default character set, and for Unicode application the driver will return the result encoded in utf8. If the encoding character set used by the application does not match the default, the result may be garbled. To this end, the user should configure the connection character set to specify the encoding of the result. For example, if the application has garbled Chinese characters, you can try to configure the connection character set to GBK or GB2312.

While configuring data source all connection character sets supported by the openLooKeng ODBC driver can be set in the **CharacterSet** drop-down box on the page 3 of the User interface. User can select the connection character from the drop-down box after the **Test DSN** is success.
